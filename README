# SMA Crossover Trading Strategy

This project will demonstrate a simple moving average crossover trading strategy using Python and PostgreSQL. The following are some tasks that this project will do:
1. Import the stock data from an Excel file into a database.
2. Apply a trading strategy based on two moving averages: short-term and long-term.
3. Validation with unit tests.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: The Excel file with the stock data.
- `database/`: SQL script to create the table, and a Python script to insert data.
- `strategy/`: A Python script implementing the moving average crossover strategy.
- `tests/`: Python unit tests to test validity of the stock data.
